Javascript DrumKit Project

This project was instructed by WesBos as part of the #javascript30 course.

Here what I have added in addition:

<ul>
  <li>Play sound on click</li>
  <li>Responsiveness</li>
  <li>Cross browser support</li>
</ul>

And now, mobile users will be able to use this cool app.
